# ccu2-EnableSSH
With this addon you can enable SSH in CCU2 via rescue system. To enter the rescue system please read http://www.eq-3.de/Downloads/eq3/pdf_FAQ/Recovery-System.pdf. Then choose 'Datei ausw√§hlen', choose the release .tar.gz (do not extract/unzip it!) and press 'start recovery'. After a short period the CCU2 will reboot. SSH will be available after reboot with the former standard root password
